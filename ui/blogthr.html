   <h1>Be interesting</h1>
               
               				<p>
               				    It's good advice, but it's nothing new. You've probably known from the beginning that being able to interest readers is a crucial part of growing a popular blog. It's pretty obvious that no one is going to stick around unless they find your blog interesting. But how are you supposed to do it exactly? How can you "be interesting?" Far too much of what we write about attention and interest is abstract. We talk about differentiation, value, and triggers - all useful concepts, but you can't point to them. You can't hold out your hand and say, "Give me some differentiation." As a result, it's hard to wrap your mind around what those things actually mean. I'd like to change that. Right now. I've been paying attention to the things that command attention, both of myself and others, and I've made a list of 10 techniques that work. This list is far from all of them I'm sure, but it should be enough to get you started.
		</p>
    <h1> 1. Be wrong</h1>

<p>
		The world is full of people trying to do the right things. It's become so common that many of us are bored by it. We long for someone that's willing to do the wrong thing, say the wrong thing, be the wrong thing. If you have the courage to be that person, you'll find lots of people paying attention to you.		
				</p>
                  <h1> 2. Be right</h1>
               
               				<p>You can also gain attention by being right, but only if you're more right than everyone else. Run a mile faster than anyone else, explain your topic more clearly than anyone else, be funnier than everyone else. Embody perfection, and people will take notice.
		</p>
    <h1>3. Communicate what others can't</h1>

<p>As writers, we take ideas from our heads and put them on the page. Sometimes we forget how difficult that is for some people and how valuable that makes us. Lots of people would give anything to be able to say what they mean. But they can't. So, they turn to songs, books, and art that communicate for them. Be a producer of those things, and you'll never lose their attention.
				
				</p>
				   <h1>4. Do something</h1>
               
               				<p>
               				    Everybody online is trying to say something important, but very few are trying to do something important. If you want attention, dare not to just give advice to others, but to live that advice yourself. Then publish it to the open web.
		</p>
    <h1>5. Surprise people</h1>

<p>Chip and Dan Heath, authors of Made to Stick, say that one of the best ways to set yourself apart is to break people's "guessing machines." Take a surprising position, making outlandish analogy, or otherwise do the opposite of what you normally do. As long as it's unexpected, people will stop and pay attention.

				   <h1>6. Make people laugh</h1>

<p>Bloggers are far too serious. We're so busy teaching that we sometimes forget to entertain. As a result, large portions of our readerships fall asleep. And what's the best way to wake people up? Humor. Public speakers have been using it for ages, and as long as it's appropriate for your audience, humor can wake your readers up and get them paying attention again.

Joining startup or MNC depends on your goals in life. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
