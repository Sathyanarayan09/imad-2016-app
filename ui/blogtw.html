have one goal and one goal only: make something valuable enough that people will actually use it. This is really the only thing that matters... 
    <h1>Must take big risks</h1>

<p>If you launch a product and its core value isn't resonating with people, making small incremental tweaks or honing in on craftsmanship isn't really going to make a difference. This is why start-ups have to move at a relentless pace and make quick decisions on major things like completely pivoting the product or hiring/firing people. Even if the decision isn't optimal, in most cases it's worse to wait and spend time doing additional research or deliberation than it is to just take the risk with the possibility of a significant pay-off. This manner of high-risk/high-reward is also why a start-up will...
				
				</p>
                <h1>Will make you feel like a directly responsible individual</h1>
              <p>If the start-up only has 20 people and it succeeds, then you'll be about 1/20 responsible for that success (give or take an order of magnitude) and you will share in all the fame/glory/riches that comes with it. If the start-up fails, then you'll be 1/20 responsible for its failure. There's no air cover above or safety net below...
				</p>  
				
                <h1>Have higher highs and lower lows</h1>
              <p>Every week in a start-up's life feels like a roller coaster. There will be despair when you check your company's internal dashboard and the number of people using your service fails to go up. There will be extreme doubt when someone you deeply respect gives you a lacklustre shrug when you show them what you've been doing. There will be flushed elation when that feature you worked all night on goes out in the next few days and you see it live and you remember how it was molded and shaped with own bare hands and you can tell your friends with pride that you did it, just you, all of it. It's for this reason that start-ups...

              <p>focus on growing what is already successful. Those days of walking about in the desert trying to find that oasis of value are over. A company that has already hit the bar of "have we made something valuable?" generally needs to sustain and bring that value to more and more people. Sheer creativity and brilliant product instincts are no longer what singularly matters, and things like good process and effective operating skills start becoming more important. Which means the company...	</p> 
             
              <h1> Will be more risk-averse</h1> 
                 
                   <p>In the sense that it's going to try really hard to not fuck up what's going well. Of course, most big companies also try to diversify what they work on and make smaller bets on new initiatives, but their primary focus (and what most of the company will work on) will be growing and optimizing the product or service that put them on the map in the first place. Sometimes, on the outside, this risk-averseness can be perceived as complacency, cowardice, or laziness. While that's certainly true in some cases, more often than not those criticism tends to be unfair because big companies...	</p>

                   <p>which means any mistakes you make become more costly. Your clients don't have the patience to wait around for you to get something right. They don't want an underdog; they want you to deliver on your promises. So in trying to prevent mistakes, big companies...	</p>

Becoming a programmer is a cumulative process that builds up your skills day after day and year after year, and programming can be fun and rewarding (mentally, spiritually and financially).
